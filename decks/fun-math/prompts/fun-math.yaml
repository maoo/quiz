introduction: |
  Fun Math is a card deck to help 5 grade students (10-11 years old) to learn mathematics in a fun way. The questions are designed to be smart, sometimes challenging, and always intriguing to spark students' interest in mathematical concepts. This deck aims to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills through engaging puzzles that combine geometry, metric system, logic problems, and other mathematical areas. The questions should encourage students to think creatively and apply mathematical principles to novel situations.

question_examples:
  extended:
    - question: "In the labyrinth shown in the picture below, there are different paths; order them from longest to shortest (longest is 1)"
      embedded_media: "Image - shows a labyrinth, and A to L letters marking the beginning and the end of invisible paths in the labyrinth"
      options: "10 different letters (A to L)"
      answers: "10 numbers that represent the rank of the solution (from longest to shortest)"
    - question: "Order these geometrical shapes from biggest to smallest (biggest is 1)"
      embedded_media: "Image - shows different shapes"
      options: "the names of the 10 geometrical shapes shown in the image"
      answers: "10 numbers that represent the rank of the solution (from biggest to smallest)"
    - question: "Calculate the area of each colored region in the figure and order them from largest to smallest (largest is 1)"
      embedded_media: "Image - shows a complex figure divided into different colored regions with dimensions labeled"
      options: "10 different colored regions labeled with letters"
      answers: "10 numbers that represent the rank of the solution (from largest to smallest)"
    - question: "These shapes are folded into 3D objects. Match each 2D pattern with the correct 3D shape it creates."
      embedded_media: "Image - shows various 2D nets/patterns that fold into 3D shapes"
      options: "10 different 3D shapes (cube, pyramid, rectangular prism, etc.)"
      answers: "10 letters corresponding to the correct 3D shape for each pattern"
