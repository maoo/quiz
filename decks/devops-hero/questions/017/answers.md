# Answers to: Order these security practices by implementation priority

1. Resource quotas - 7
2. Network policies - 3
3. RBAC implementation - 1
4. Container scanning - 4
5. Secret management - 2
6. Pod security context - 5
7. Image signing - 8
8. Namespace isolation - 6
9. Admission controllers - 9
10. Seccomp profiles - 10

Notes on priority order (highest to lowest):
1. RBAC implementation - Critical for controlling who can access and modify cluster resources
2. Secret management - Protects sensitive information from exposure
3. Network policies - Controls pod-to-pod communication, limiting attack surface
4. Container scanning - Identifies vulnerabilities before deployment
5. Pod security context - Enforces security settings at pod runtime
6. Namespace isolation - Separates workloads and applies security boundaries
7. Resource quotas - Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
8. Image signing - Ensures image integrity and authenticity
9. Admission controllers - Enforces policies during resource creation
10. Seccomp profiles - Restricts system calls, but often implemented later
