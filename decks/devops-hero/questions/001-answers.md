## Explanation
This question tests knowledge of which projects have officially graduated from the CNCF incubation process. Graduated projects have demonstrated widespread adoption, a healthy contributor base, and commitment to the CNCF principles. Istio is a service mesh project maintained by Google, not a CNCF project. Docker donated containerd to CNCF but Docker itself is not a CNCF project. Jenkins is a CI/CD tool maintained by the Jenkins project, not CNCF. Traefik is an open-source project but not part of CNCF. OpenShift is Red Hat's Kubernetes platform, not a CNCF project.
