# Answers to: Identify best practices in this Terraform code

1. Uses modules - TRUE
2. Has version pinning - TRUE
3. Uses variables - FALSE
4. Has proper tagging - TRUE
5. Has state locking - FALSE
6. Uses workspaces - FALSE
7. Has remote backend - FALSE
8. Uses data sources - FALSE
9. Enables encryption - FALSE
10. Uses conditionals - FALSE

Notes:
- The configuration uses the AWS VPC module, showing modular design
- Version is pinned in the module (3.14.0), following best practices
- No variables are defined in this configuration
- Proper tagging is present (Environment, Terraform, Owner)
- No state locking configuration is shown (would need backend with locking)
- No workspace configuration is present
- No remote backend is configured (like S3 or Terraform Cloud)
- No data sources are used
- No specific encryption settings are enabled
- No conditional expressions (count, for_each, etc.) are used
