## Usage

Using Claude Code (or ChatGPT), it should be possible to ask:
```
Follow instructions in quiz-prompt.md, to build a quiz deck of type devops-hero; only generate 2 questions, one of type code-block, one of type Knowledge-Based; only using the content of the prompt as context. 
```

To reiterate on existing questions:
```
Follow instructions in quiz-prompt.md, to build a quiz deck of type devops-hero; only generate 2 questions, one of type code-block, one of type Knowledge-Based; you can reuse the .md files that were previously generated, but svg files must be recreated from scratch, only using the content of the prompt as context. 
```
